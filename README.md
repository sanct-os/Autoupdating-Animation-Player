-- AUTOUPDATING ROBLOX ANIMATION PLAYER C++ --

-- made by adam (sanct.os on discord) --

-- if you plan on learning off of this and you make your own project with it, please credit me.

This project is terrible and should only be used to learn reverse engineering, yes you can use it as a cheat but it's horrible.

This shouldn't get patched anytime soon, because it automatically updates itself each game you join and use it on.

IMPORTANT:
---
I am 50% sure that after I revamped this in github's web code editor that I probably messed up some things in the core files that will make it not able to run, so if it can't run, just paste the code into your own project (the .cpp file only)
---
If you do use this as a cheat, it'll take a while to play the animation and can crash sometimes.
